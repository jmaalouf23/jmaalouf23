## 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph Maalouf

I am a 5th year PhD student in the chemical engineering department at MIT.  I work at the intersection of electrochemistry, machine learning, and high throughput computation to develop technologies and materials that can convert carbon dioxide, air, water, and renewable electricity into commodities like fuels, and plastic precursors.

### 👀 I’m passionate about

- ⛽   Decarbonization of materials like fuels and plastics
-  ⚡   Electrochemistry
- 💻   Machine learning for molecular property prediction
- ⚛️   Pursuing a career in computational chemistry
